Description
-----------
This package contains an algorithm to process EEG and EMG recordings which
were impaired by artifacts from a concurrent fMRI acquisition.

The algorithm is based on the EEGLAB plugin by Rami K. Niazy, FMRIB Centre,
University of Oxford.

The original EEGLAB plugin was completely rewritten with a clearer
structure, object oriented programming paradigm, expressive identifiers and
lots of speed improvements. The main improvement are extensions of
usability and features.

Usage
-----
To perform the algorithm with the example scripts use e.g.
  cleaned = CleanEx1(EEG_FMRIB);
To get identical results for consecutive runs, don't forget to seed the
random number generator with identical values, e.g.
  rand('seed',0), cleaned = CleanEx1(EEG_FMRIB);

For the evaluation of the correction results use e.g.
  e=FACET.EvalPrintText(FACET.Eval(EEG_FMRIB,cleaned,21,[1:30]).eval()).print();
for the FMRIB dataset.

To evaluate the data from Fischi use e.g.
  e=FACET.EvalPrintText(FACET.Eval(EEG_Fischi,cleaned,[1:13,16:22],27073,29000,639126,648987,0.5000,12.5000).eval()).print();

To evaluate the data from Aachen (processed with CleanEx3.m) use e.g.
  e=FACET.EvalPrintText(FACET.Eval(EEG_Aachen,cleaned,[1:31],35500,36500,3755500,3756000,0.5000,16.5000).eval()).print();
